                    <p class="justify">Undergraduate students are encouraged to work in biomedical laboratories as early
                      in their career as possible.  Students working in Orthopaedic Biomechanics Laboratory
                      participate in characterization of transport and electrical properties of cartilaginous
                      tissues, apparatus design and testing, and investigating physiochemical effects on cells.
                      Students are encouraged to present their projects at the University of Miami Research and
                      Creativity Forum.  Exceptional students are invited to present posters at international conferences.
