            <p class="justify">Our laboratory is dedicated to the investigation of transport properties and nutritional supply to
            cells and tissues along with the biomechanics of soft tissues. At the cellular level, we work to understand
            the behavior of cells and how changes in physiological conditions affect the degenerative state of tissues
            in the intervertebral disc. At the tissue level, we look at transport properties through knee meniscus tissues
            in order to understand the onset and causes of osteoarthritis.</p>

                    <h3>Cellular Level</h3>
                    <p class="justify">Alhough many tissue properties of intervertebral disc (IVD) have been studied, there are still gaps in the
                    cellular behavior of IVD cells and how their behavior leads to degeneration. In this lab, we
                    are studying the phenotypic expression of a host of different genes related to ECM regulation,
                    as well as monitoring the metabolic activity of cells.</p>

                    <h3>Tissue Level</h3>
                    <p class="justify"> Knee meniscus tissues are avascular tissues that assist in load bearing and shock absorption
                    in the knee, amongst other functions. Due to its lack of vascularization, nutrients and fluids
                    must find alternative means of reaching the inner areas of the meniscus. In this lab, we are
                    studying different transport properties of knee meniscus tissues. </p>
