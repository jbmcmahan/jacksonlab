            <p class="justify">Our laboratory is dedicated to the investigation of transport properties and nutritional supply to
            cells and tissues along with the biomechanics of soft tissues. At the cellular level, we work to understand
            the behavior of cells and how changes in physiological conditions affect the degenerative state of tissues
            in the intervertebral disc. At the tissue level, we look at transport properties through knee meniscus tissues
            in order to understand the onset and causes of osteoarthritis.</p>

                    <h3>Cellular Level</h3>
                    <p class="justify">The intervertebral disc (IVD) is the largest avascular structure in the body. Its primary
                    function is to transmit and cushion loads across the spine while giving the spine motion. Due
                    to the lack of vascularity, the IVD is generally found to in a state of degeneration in adults.
                    Though many tissue properties of the discs have been studied, there are still gaps in the
                    cellular behavior of IVD cells and how their behavior leads to degeneration. In this lab, we
                    are studying the phenotypic expression of a host of different genes related to ECM regulation,
                    as well as monitoring the metabolic activity of cells.</p>

                    <p class="justify">Our long term goals of these studies are to (1) better characterize the phenotypic changes
                    associated with disc degeneration; (2) observe how these changes affect the matrix composition
                    of the IVD; and (3) identify potential targets for treatment of degenerative disc disease.

                    <h3>Tissue Level</h3>
                    <p class="justify"> Knee meniscus tissues are avascular tissues that assist in load bearing and shock absorption
                    in the knee, amongst other functions. Due to its lack of vascularization, nutrients and fluids
                    must find alternative means of reaching the inner areas of the meniscus. In this lab, we are
                    studying different transport properties of knee meniscus tissues. </p>

                    <p class="justify">Some of the properties being investigated include: the apparent glucose diffusivity, electrical
                    conductivity, the glucose partition coefficient, and hydraulic permeability. </p>

                    <p class="justify">Our long term goals are to (1) better understand the pathophysiology involved in the development
                    of knee meniscus injury and degeneration; (2) explore the roles of solute and fluid transport in
                    the nutritional supply and mechanical functioning of the meniscus in order to more fully understand
                    the origins of meniscal degradation; and (3) identify effective treatment solutions for Osteoarthritis.
