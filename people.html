                    <h5 class="align-left">Assistant Professor, Department of Biomedical Engineering</h6>
                    <p class="justify">
                      Dr. Jackson joined the faculty in the Department of Biomedical Engineering
                      at the University of Miami in August 2011. She received her PhD under Dr.
                      Weiyong Gu in BME at UM in 2010 for her work on Transport and Metabolism
                      of Glucose in Intervertebral Disc which combined both experimental and
                      theoretical approaches. She also received her MSBE (2007) and BSBE (2005)
                      degrees from UM BME. As the director of the Orthopaedic Biomechanics Laboratory,
                      Dr. Jackson is interested in characterizing the transport and electromechanical
                      properties of the fibrocartilaginous meniscus of the knee, in order to more fully
                      understand the tissue pathology and contribute to the development of new
                      strategies for treatment. She is also interested in elucidating the roles of
                      physicochemical cues (e.g., nutrition, mechanical loading) in the degeneration
                      cascade in intervertebral disc tissues, with particular emphasis on the notochordal
                      nucleus pulposus cells. Dr. Jackson currently teaches Biomedical Transport
                      Phenomena (BME 450), a required course for all BME undergraduate students.

                    <h6>Ph.D. Candidate in Biomedical Engineering</h5>

                    <p class="justify">
                        Kelseyâ€™s work focuses on the effect of different parameters on the
                        apparent glucose diffusion coefficient, electrical conductivity,
                        glucose partition coefficient, and hydraulic permeability of healthy
                        porcine knee meniscus tissues. Her goal is to investigate baseline
                        characteristics of meniscus in the hope of accelerating osteoarthritis
                        research, and aims to eventually design athletic equipment with a
                        focus on safety testing. Outside of work, Kelsey loves to bake, is a
                        huge sports fan, and enjoys running around the city of Miami.
