                    <h2>Overview</h2>

                    <p class="justify">The intervertebral disc (IVD) is the largest avascular structure in the body. Its primary
                    function is to transmit and cushion loads across the spine while giving the spine motion. Due
                    to the lack of vascularity, the IVD is generally found to be in a state of degeneration in adults.
                    Though many tissue properties of the discs have been studied, there are still gaps in the
                    cellular behavior of IVD cells and how their behavior leads to degeneration. In this lab, we
                    are studying the phenotypic expression of a host of different genes related to ECM regulation,
                    as well as monitoring the metabolic activity of cells.</p>

                    <p class="justify">Our long term goals of these studies are to (1) better characterize the phenotypic changes
                    associated with disc degeneration; (2) observe how these changes affect the matrix composition
                    of the IVD; and (3) identify potential targets for treatment of degenerative disc disease.
